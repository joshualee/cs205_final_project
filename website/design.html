              <h2>Parallel Max-Flow Min-Cut</h2>
                <p> We implemented parallel versions of max-flow in both MapReduce and MPI. 
                    Both implementations are based off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm">Ford-Fulkerson</a> algorithm.
                </p
                <h3> Challenges </h3>
                <p> In the context of MapReduce, each mapper and reducer only has a local view of 
                    the graph. However, Ford Fulkerson runs by using a depth first search to find a 
                    path from the source node to the sink node. We simulate a DFS by having each node 
                    append one extra edge to the path. On the face this method may seem inefficient, 
                    since it now requires D iterations of MapReduce in order to find a path of length 
                    D. However, our MapReduce algorithm makes up for this by exploring multiple paths 
                    at once.
                </p>
                <p> Since each mapper only has a local view of the graph, a significant challenge 
                    is to ensure each mapper's local view of the graph is updated when a path is 
                    accepted by the algorithm (i.e. updating edge capacities to account for the 
                    amount of flow already sent across). This is accomplished by having the reducer 
                    emit a dictionary of the augmented edges each round. Each mapper starts by 
                    checking this dictionary and updating any of its affected edges. 
                </p>
                <p> Parallel versions of Max-Flow do exist. One of the most famous is the so 
                    called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm">Push-Relabel</a> algorithm. 
                    However we observed this algorithm is not well suited to MapReduce for the 
                    following reasons. (1) There are a low number of "active" nodes, meaning that 
                    even if we have a large number of mappers running, only a few are doing 
                    useful work. (2) A significant portion of the algorithm relies on using 
                    heuristics to decide which vertices to use. A bad guess by the heuristic 
                    can result in wasted rounds of MR in order to correct the mistake.
                </p>
                <h3> Graph Representation </h3>
                <p> To represent the graph as a file, we use an adjacency list representation. 
                    This representation makes the most sense for MapReduce because each mapper is 
                    responsible for a single vertex, so it needs to know all of that vertex’s 
                    neighbors. Furthermore by using this general graph format, we can easily 
                    convert any graph that we want to run MapReduce on to this format. We use the 
                    convention to denote the source node as “s” and the sink node as “t”. 

                <h4> Format: </h4>
                    <p> "vertex_id" \t [["neighbor_id_1", edge_capacity_1], ["neighbor_id_2", 
                        edge_capacity_2], ...]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example:
    
                        <ul class="well" style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li> "s" [["1", 2], ["2", 2]] </li>
                        <li> "0" [["s", 7], ["t", 4], ["1", 3], ["2", 1]] </li> 
                        <li> "1" [["s", 6], ["t", 2]] </li>
                        <li> "2" [["s", 10], ["0", 8], ["1", 2]] </li>
                        <li> "t" [] </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </p>
                
                <h3> MapReduce </h3>
                <p> Our MapReduce algorithm operates on the following (key, value) pair:
                </p>
                <ul class="well" style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li> key: &lt;vertex ID&gt; </li>
                    <li> value: (S_u, T_u, E_u)</li>
                    <li> S_u: list of source excess paths from "s" to "u"</li>
                    <li> T_u: list of sink excess paths from "u" to "t"</li>
                    <li> E_u: list containing neighbors of "u" in the format (e_v, e_id, e_f, e_c) 
                    where e_v is the vertex id, e_id is the edge id, e_f is the amount of flow 
                    sent across the edge, e_c is the original capacity of the edge</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Our mapper has three responsibilities. (1) First it updates all edges in the 
                    local view of the graph. This is information is sent from the reducer in the 
                    previous iteration. (2) Second it generates new augmenting paths by coming 
                    source excess paths with sink excess paths. (3) Third it extends excess paths 
                    by one edge. The mapper yields these new paths along with the original 
                    structure of the graph to the reducer.
                </p>
                <p> Our reducer has three responsibilities. (1) First it checks the validity of 
                    all accept augmenting paths and throws away any that violate capacity constraints. 
                    If the reducer is processing the sink node "t", these accepted paths represent the 
                    augmenting paths we actually send flow across. (2) Second it outputs the number of 
                    excess paths to the driver. This allows the driver to test for convergence. 
                    (3) Third it outputs the dictionary of augmented edges for the mapper to perform 
                    graph updates on the next iteration.
                </p>
                <p> Our MapReduce algorithm uses an Accumulator data structure to check the 
                    validity of candidate. It is convenient to use abstraction so our MapReduce 
                    algorithm can concentrate on finding candidate paths without having to spill 
                    in the logic of ensuring the candidate path is valid in the global view of 
                    the graph. The accumulator is used in both the mapper and reducer.
                </p>
                <p> Since calculating the max flow requires multiple iterations of our MapReduce 
                    algorithm, we use a driver to handle the job flow. The driver is also 
                    responsible for converting a graph in adjacency list format into the format 
                    required by our MapReduce. The driver also detects if our MapReduce algorithm 
                    is finished by seeing if the number of candidate paths from "s" to "t" does not 
                    change after several iterations.
                </p>
                
                <h3> MPI </h3>
                
                <p> For our MPI implementation, we use a master/slave model. The master is 
                    responsible for:
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li> Distributing a copy of the graph to each slave </li>
                    <li> Allocating new jobs to idle slaves. Master sends the slave a node 
                        "u" which is a neighbor of "s". </li>
                    <li> Receiving candidate paths from the slaves, checking if it is a valid path, 
                         and accepting the path. </li>
                    <li> Sending slaves accepted paths so each slave can update their own local 
                         copy of the graph </li>
                    <li> Determine when to converge (no more paths from "s" to "t") </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p> Each slave is responsible for: </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li> Finding a path from "s" to "u" to "t" via a DFS (where "u" is the node 
                         assigned to the slave by the master) </li>
                    <li> Sending the candidate path back to the master for acceptance. </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p> For all communication, we use simple send and receives, since this seemed best 
                    suited for the master/slave model (other parallel primitives such as broadcast 
                    would require synchronizing communication across all slaves which is not ideal 
                    for this model).
                </p>
                
                <h2> Image Segmentation </h2>
                <h3> Image Processor </h3>
                <p> The image processor is responsible for converting an image into a graph in 
                    adjacency list format and writing it to a file as described in the introduction 
                    section. Here we are utilizing the fact that our max-flow algorithms accept 
                    any graph in adjacency list format.
                </p>
                <h3> Segmenter </h3>
                <p> The segmenter is the driver that performs the binary image segmentation. 
                    It takes the input image, runs it through the image processor to create a 
                    graph, then takes the graph and gives it to our MapReduce implementation of 
                    Max-Flow. Our MapReduce algorithm returns to us the minimum cut, which the 
                    segmenter then uses to label each pixel as either foreground or background. 
                    Finally, the segmenter outputs a new image with foreground and background 
                    labeled in black and white.
