				<h3>What interesting insights did you gain from this project?</h3>
				<p>We gained many insights into parallel programming from this project. In particular, we learned that not all algorithms are suitable for parallelization. The Ford Fulkerson algorithm has a very simple serial solution that depends on finding a full path from the source to the sink before making updates to the graph. However this model of the algorithm does not give enough computation at each step for a good parallel algorithm. Therefore, we had to completely change the way that we thought about the algorithm in order to come up with a parallel solution.</p>

				<p>We also learned that the success of a parallel solution lies in its ability to create enough work for each of the machines that are used in computation. This is a direct interpretation of Amdahl's Law and the idea that parallelization efforts are only as effective as the portion of a program that can be parallelized. In the context of both our MapReduce and MPI Max-Flow Min-Cut algorithm, this meant keeping a high level of "active nodes", which are the nodes that are extending augumenting paths in the graph.</p> 

				<p>Another insight that we gained from this project is that you must fully understand the serial version of an algorithm before attempting to convert it into a parallel solution. As discussed previously, parallel algorithms often require a complicated and unintuitive way of thinking about a problem. Without first having a solid understanding for an existing solution to a problem, it can become difficult to implement and debug parallel implementations. Debugging, in particular, cam be very cumbersome without a good understanding of the problem and solution at hand.</p>

				<p>Finally, we learned that good documentation is an essential part of making an easy-to-use API. One huge barrier to our successfully increasing the speed of our MapReduce solution was our inabillity to bootstrap files on Amazon's EMR. (See Improvements for more discussion on this problem) This could easily have been overcome had the MrJob documentation been more thorough.</p>
